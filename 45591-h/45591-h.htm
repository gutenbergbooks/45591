<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">That</span> man is a gentleman!" How the heart opens
to let him in, without any further commendation! He
may be wise, and rich, and remarked for his genius; but
if he be not a true gentleman, his gifts will not avail
to make him a favorite and a desirable companion.</p>

<p>"That woman is a lady!" What matter, then, if she
is not clad in silks, or is not beautiful of form or feature?
She has the key which unlocks all hearts for her,
for to be a lady, implies high qualities and gracious gifts
of soul.</p>

<p>Why, then, are not all persons gentlemen and ladies?
We can not tell, except it be that some, and a large
class of, persons look upon politeness as something effeminate,
or as fit only for fops; and therefore make boors of
themselves, because it is so manly to be coarse and to do
just as one pleases. Some are actually ignorant of what
constitutes true politeness, and err not from willfulness,
but from want of knowledge. But such persons are readily
forgivable, for, if their disposition is to be polite, they
will find the way very easy into the confidence of all,
and will learn, ere long, what custom and usage has sanctioned
as fit and proper regulations for the intercourse
of men with men, women with women, and all with one
another.</p>

<p>It is to such persons as those last-named, that we especially
address this little manual. To learn the usages of
society is easy, if one only <i>will</i> learn; for, after all, these
usages are not complicated and burdensome, but grounded
upon simplicity itself: the great law which underlies
all, is the blessed Golden Rule:</p>

<div class='center'>
"<i>Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you.</i>"<br />
</div>

<p>We propose to give such suggestions, in the various departments
of social experience, as will advise the reader
of the usages sanctioned by eminent authority, and of
the deportment proper and acceptable to well-bred persons;
and flatter ourselves that, if our advice is followed,
this "<span class="smcap">Dime Book of Etiquette</span>" will prove entirely competent
to fit its attentive reader to move with credit and
self-respect in any circle where a true lady or gentleman
always finds ready recognition.</p>

<h2>ENTRANCE INTO SOCIETY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Has</span> the moment arrived when you are called upon
to cast aside your youthful associations and youthful
irresponsibilities to take your place in society as a man
or woman? It is a most important moment&mdash;one
which deserves the consideration of a thoughtful study;
for, upon a proper knowledge of what belongs to
true manhood, true womanhood, does much of your
after-life success depend. If you are ignorant of the
laws of politeness, of the rules and observances of true
sociality, of the means necessary to render yourself
an agreeable companion and a useful member of the
social circle, you begin life at immense disadvantage,
and will never cease to regret that ignorance. It is
such an easy matter to become familiar with the
usages and proprieties of social life that ignorance is
inexcusable; and when we see men of sense and sagacity
behaving, in an assembly, at a party, at the
dinner-table, at the card-table, like half-tutored savages,&mdash;rude,
awkward, uncivil, a source of annoyance to
their friends, we feel a degree of indignation rather
than of pity, since it is so easy to learn how to behave,
that there really is no good excuse for boorishness
and awkward deportment.</p>

<p>To illustrate, let us narrate the case of our young
friend Falconbridge, whose <i>entree</i> into society afforded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
a subject of laughter and comment for weeks after the
incidents which he has had the courage to place before
us as a warning. He tells his story thus:</p>

<p>"I pulled the bell with a most nervous twitch; I
'walked in' with fear and misgivings; in the parlor
not only sat Miss Jones, but her two cousins, the old
lady, a maiden aunt, and some four or five of the
junior branches of the Jones family. I got through,
though it was fearful work. I set my hat on the
center-table, and it fell off; I picked it up, and in doing
so, hit my nose against a pile of gilt-edged literature,
and down it came pell-mell; but the children
came to my rescue, and I finally found myself armed
by a lady each side&mdash;the cousins! Imagine my feelings&mdash;Miss
J. going in advance, <i>en route</i>, down the
avenue to the portly residence of Misses Degrands.
We entered the vestibule; I had not spoken a word
all the way; the two pretty cousins and Miss J. doing
a heap of conversation. In the hall the old negro
servant made a grab at my hat, but I held on, and in
triumph carried it into the parlor, where, in the midst
of introductions, flaring of lamps, and waving and
fluttering of silks and cashmeres, bowing, scraping,
fuss and feathers, to all of which I was more or less
deaf and blind, down upon a piano-stool in the corner
I dropped my hat.</p>

<p>"The two cousins froze to me, introduced me; I
bowed; one of the Miss Degrands came forward; I
was introduced, and as she, in the tip of fashion, made
her perfectly grand theatrical bow to me, grabbed her
by the hand in the most democratic manner imaginable,
and shook it most heartily. She not only blushed,
but, by her eyes, I saw that she was likewise mad
as a hornet. Her sister and her had a word, and
then her sister avoided me. Things grew no better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
fast; from one bungle I got into another. In <i>whist</i> I
was ignorant and awkward; in a hop waltz with one
of the cousins, I trod on her toes, until she screamed;
and, in trying to mend the matter, I stepped on the
flounces of Miss Degrand's dress and tore off five
yards at least. In despair, I backed down, saw a
seat, rushed to it, and down I sat upon my hat! In
confusion I arose, snatched up the pancake-looking
affair, which I frenziedly held up to public gaze.
There was a roar of laughter&mdash;in which I did not
join, I assure you; I gave a rush forward, hit the
corner of the table, tilted over the astral lamp!&mdash;such
a crash!&mdash;I kept on, I made for the door which just
then old Degrand was entering <i>avant courier</i> of his
old negro man, who bore a large tray well filled with
wine in glasses. I struck the old gentleman so forcibly
that he fell upon Pompey, glasses, and wine; and,
on my mad career, I proceeded. Going out the
wrong end of the hall, I found myself in a dark dining-room;
but, jerking open the first door in advance,
I went out into a hall, thence to an anteroom; groping
in the dark, I struck my forehead against a half-open
door, saw bushels of stars, and&mdash;<i>fell senseless</i>!</p>

<p>"How or when I got home, the Lord only knows;
but, for one week, I had a head too big for my hat,
and a pair of terrifically black eyes. As soon as able
to travel, I left that 'settlement' never to return."</p>

<p>Now this is no overwrought scene, but one which
could easily have happened to any bashful, awkward,
disconcerted young person. The great error he made
was in not going into society perfectly <i>self-possessed</i>,
from having a right knowledge of what was proper in
company. In the first place, he had <i>waited too long</i>
before entering into society, and, secondly, he had not
informed himself at all upon the most common proprieties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of the parlor. What else could have been expected
than discomfiture and disgrace?</p>

<p>As a rule, then, let us recommend all young persons
to enter into social intercourse ere they become
"of age." It is a most admirable experience to meet in
friendly chat with a friend or two&mdash;to spend an evening
with an intelligent lady, and to learn by degrees
the confidence and reliance which will serve to carry
you bravely through the evening at the brilliant
rooms of fashion and gay company. It will be found,
by both sexes, that timidity wears off rapidly by simple
social converse; and the young man or woman
who proposes to become a gentleman or lady should
not fail to embrace every opportunity for meeting
with well-mannered and intelligent friends&mdash;to spend
an evening with them&mdash;to read, talk, walk, ride with
them&mdash;to go out to concerts, to the theater, to the
pic-nic, excursion, church, or evening party.</p>

<p>Timidity is not a sin&mdash;it is merely a <i>fault</i> which
will soon wear away, and a proper self-possession will
take its place, if the novice in society will use all
necessary means to overcome the feeling which takes
fright at a smile, and is disconcerted by a frown.</p>

<p>In seeking to overcome bashfulness, let there be a
careful study to avoid the very common extreme of
forwardness. This is the more unbearable because it
is a sin of commission, while bashfulness is a sin of
omission. To be forward, rude, intrusive, argues a
sad want of good breeding which no leniency will
overlook. In a female this rudeness is absolutely unbearable,
because it so outrages all ideas of feminine
graces and virtues&mdash;it makes us think the person
<i>coarse</i>, and this very feeling divests us of the respect,
the reverence which should always be felt for the
"gentle sex." We say earnestly to those young girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
who bandy words with provoking young men, who
always romp when they are abroad, and win the
name of being "independent," that you very much
injure yourself in the estimation of all well-mannered
persons, and do your character the injustice of having
it considered <i>un</i>-feminine. Be gay, be cheerful, be
the spirit of every company, but at the same time preserve
the delicacy, the refinement, the grace, which
are the surest virtues for conquering admiration, for
winning love.</p>

<p>"Snobs" are always impudent, and generally are
ignorant persons. They are rude as the monkey is
rude, because they really do not know what constitutes
good breeding. Their tailor literally "makes
the man"&mdash;their whole mind is given to the tie
of their cravat, and their boots absorb much of
their hardest efforts at philosophy. They are simply
nuisances&mdash;a blot on the fair name of man; and
should be regarded as an <i>extensive</i> species of ape.</p>

<p>"Fops" are not always "snobs." A person may
be very vain of dress, and make a silly display of dry
goods and jewelry, and still be very genteel and perfectly
polished in manners. The love of show is a
strong passion in a larger class of persons than is generally
supposed, for many who do not wear the latest
styles still have peculiarities of dress or ornament
which are the result of as great a degree of vanity as
besets the more gaudily dressed. It is a weakness to
be vain of dress, for it places a virtue in goods which
does not belong to it&mdash;it elevates a perishable and
purchasable commodity above the truer and nobler
attributes of mind.</p>

<p>"Bores" are a large class, and number such a variety
of species as to baffle definition. Let it suffice
for us to say, a man or woman is a bore when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
are <i>intruders</i>, either upon persons' time or company.
To know when to leave, when to cease conversation,
when to offer attentions, to solicit favors, is to know
how to behave well; and no person will err who is
educated in gentility, or whose apprehension of what
is right is not befogged by "charming illusions." One
of the worst bores we ever met was a female, who
acted as a kind of purveyor-general to the community
for every charity which called for an active benevolence.
This lady would come into our study at any
moment, would force us into hearing which we did
not wish to hear, and into giving what we did not
conscientiously think it right to give&mdash;so great was
her faculty for "talking things into a person." She
and her friends thought her a very valuable woman; we
then thought her to be, and now know her to have
been, a most unmitigated bore of the "benevolent"
school.</p>

<p>We have here described these several enemies of
good breeding, because we do not wish to recur to
them again: let us here beg of our readers to make
such application of the suggestions as will prevent
any of them from becoming either "snobs," "fops,"
or "bores."</p>

<p>Once in the presence of company, large or small,
forget yourself so far as to become <i>one of the number</i>&mdash;lose
yourself, your hands, and feet, and eyes, in the
feeling of non-individualism, without which there really
can be no real enjoyment. What is called <i>abandon</i>
is a sense of non-individuality&mdash;a forgetfulness of
self so far as to enter keenly into the spirit of the
time and occasion. Give yourself no particular <i>anxiety</i>
about your person, your demeanor, your words
and ways: you can, if not perfectly "at home," have a
care to demean yourself well and creditably; but do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
not be anxious about it, for anxiety breeds a disquiet
which is fatal to enjoyment and to a good impression
upon others. Good-nature is every thing in society,
as in business&mdash;it overcomes many a mountain of
difficulty, and achieves a success where no sternness
or anxious solicitude would avail.</p>

<p>In regard to the formulas of introductions, cards of
invitation, etc., too much stress is laid by writers upon
etiquette, who leave the impression that there is a
whole chapter of Greek verbs to learn before the debutant
in society can become familiar with necessary
forms. There is little, indeed, to cause alarm, the
forms being just what any person's common-sense
would dictate as being proper. We will give, in the
chapter succeeding, such general observances and
formulas for introductions, etc., as seem necessary to
"post" our readers upon the subject.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>GENERAL OBSERVANCES, INTRODUCTIONS, ETC.</h2>


<p>Among the gentilities of life, visits hold a first
place, and deserve attention. Their various occasion,
their different character and purpose, their
meaning are multiple, and have, therefore, some
forms necessary to be preserved. We may remark
that visits are classified as follows, viz.: visits of mere
form and policy; visits of real friendship; visits of congratulation
and of condolence; visits to give out invitations
for dinner, or a dance, or an evening party; visits
of state, where the party called upon is a "lion," an
eminent person, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The general style of dress to be adopted upon all
these occasions, is one of studied neatness rather
than of display or of elegance. Display upon such
occasions is really vulgar&mdash;it should be reserved for
the gay and brilliant soiree or evening company, if it
is made at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>time</i> for the visit is <i>after</i> twelve o'clock, noon;
before that hour the lady of the house is supposed to
be busy at her household duties, and in getting the
rooms in order for the day: never make a call before
that hour.</p>

<p>Occupy but a brief time in your call, for you know
not how much the lady of the house may have to
do, nor where she may wish to go, hence it is best
always to make your call brief. If strongly urged to
remain longer, it would be impolite to go in haste;
but, as a general thing, let fifteen or twenty minutes
be the time spent in the visit. You will not then be
voted a "bore," but, on the other hand, will be considered
a pleasant caller&mdash;particularly if you have
made yourself agreeable.</p>

<p>Should another person be announced or enter on a
visit before your own visit is finished, it is but proper
for you immediately to retire, unless you may be intimate
with both the host and the new-comer, and are
invited to remain. Otherwise be not precipitate to
leave, but politely withdraw, for you do not know
what "confidences" there may be to be talked over.</p>

<p>Visits of congratulation upon occasion of marriage,
or safe return from a journey, or long absence, or escape
from calamity, should be at as early a moment as the
party seems ready for such visits; and should be always
made when you entertain a regard for the person interested.
It is now the practice for newly-married people
to send out their cards to those of their old friends with
whom they wish to renew acquaintance in their new
relationships; and it is a sign that you do not wish
to renew the acquaintance if you fail to respond to
the card by calling. If you fail to call, the parties
can not consistently recognize you afterward, except
you have some good and sufficient apology to offer
for your absence from their reception-rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Visits of condolence are too much neglected in this
"fast" country of ours. In Europe the custom of
calling upon those who have suffered a loss by death
is quite general. The call, of course, should be brief,
and the words offered of the kindest and most considerate
character. It will greatly relieve the pangs
of sorrow for the living to feel that others are solicitous
for their welfare.</p>

<p>After you have attended a party, soiree, or sociable,
it is proper to call upon your host within a fortnight,
to make inquiries after his or her health, and
to remark upon the pleasure you experienced on the
occasion of the party. This is a pleasant way of
showing your friends that their efforts to please you
are appreciated.</p>

<p>New Year visits, strangely enough, are not general
in this country outside of a few large cities. The
first day of the New Year is set apart for general
"calls," when houses are "open," and all are privileged
to enter who are friends of the host, or who are
in company with a person who is on the calling list
of the house. It is <i>not</i> proper for a perfect stranger
to enter a room and introduce himself to the ladies
present, just because the door is "open;" if you wish
to call upon the receivers of company, get some
proper friend to introduce you. Even the freedom of
New Year's day will not excuse a liberty with
strangers.</p>

<p>In many instances houses are not open to "calls,"
on New Year's day, for various reasons. In cases of
this kind, it is a pleasant reminder of your existence,
and of your wish to continue your social relations for
the year, to send in your card sometime during January,
or, what is better, to call sometime during the
month, and re-establish yourself in the list of friends
of the party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the various <i>technicalities</i> of these several occasions,
we may say:</p>

<p>Never forget to enter the room with thoroughly-cleaned
boots. Always use the scraper and mats at
the door.</p>

<p>If you meet any one on the staircase, you should
uncover, whoever it may be. You should do the
same in case of an introduction.</p>

<p>If you have a cane, keep it in your hand, and be
careful not to make much noise with your boots.</p>

<p>When a new visitor enters a drawing-room, if it be
a gentleman, the ladies bow slightly; if a lady, every
one rises.</p>

<p>Beware of asking the hour, or of taking out your
watch during a visit; avoid spitting on the floor&mdash;your
pocket-handkerchief will serve your purpose. To
place your hat on any article of furniture when you
enter a room is ungenteel; to lay it on a bed is unpardonable.
You must hold it in your hand, or
leave it with your over-coat in the anteroom. Crossing
the legs, and stretching them out at full length,
are equally improper.</p>

<p>The last arrival in a drawing-room takes a seat left
vacant near the mistress of the house.</p>

<p>A lady is not required to rise on receiving a gentleman,
nor to accompany him to the door.</p>

<p>If you are invited to lay down your hat, place it
beside, <i>not</i> before you.</p>

<p>A <i>young</i> man will avoid sitting in an arm-chair&mdash;which
should always be awarded to the ladies or old
gentlemen present. Leave the seat next the fire to
superiors in age or position. The children of the
family should assist their parents in receiving visitors,
relieve the ladies of their wrappings, provide seats,
and accompany to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Never look about you in a room, as if you were
making an inventory.</p>

<p>The gloves should not be removed during a visit.
To brush your hat with your hand will expose you
to the charge of extreme vulgarity.</p>

<p>At the entrance of a visitor you should rise. A
professional man in his office is alone exempted from
this custom.</p>

<p>A lady does not put her address on her visiting-card.
We may here also add these further general
hints and suggestions:</p>

<p>Naturalness is an essential item in good-breeding.
Hear what La Bruyere thinks on this important question:
"Some young people do not sufficiently understand
the advantages of natural charms, and how
much they would gain by trusting to them entirely.
They weaken these gifts of heaven, so rare and fragile,
by affected manners and an awkward imitation.
Their tones and their gait are borrowed; they study
their attitudes before the glass, until they have lost
all trace of natural manner, and, with all their pains,
they please but little."</p>

<p>Without being vain, a young girl should be careful
of her person. Nothing is more repugnant to good
taste, than an air of neglect in the toilet and deportment
of woman. The hair and head-dress especially
require care and neatness.</p>

<p>Beware of imitating those people who never know
what to do with their bodies, and can never keep their
hands quiet.</p>

<p>Swinging on one's chair is extremely ill-bred.</p>

<p>The eye-glass stuck in the eye, denotes either the
dandy, the clerk, or the student. This custom is in
no way disagreeable to the passers-by, but it has an
air of ill-breeding and impertinence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>To follow a lady in the street, and turn the head
to stare at her, is still more impertinent than to do so
in a promenade, especially in cities, for reasons which
can not be further averted to in a book intended for
young persons of both sexes.</p>

<p>Familiarity with servants should be avoided, but
they should always be addressed with civility.</p>

<p>Some people, in speaking to you, have a silly habit
of passing their hand through the hair, or stroking
the mustache; some even carry a pocket-comb, which
they produce on all occasions, for dressing the beard;
others bite their nails, play with their watch-key, or
jingle the money in their pocket; all these offences
against propriety denote a want of good-breeding.</p>

<p>Excess in perfume should be avoided, lest the suspicion
be excited that you deal in the odors that you
inhale.</p>

<p>Good-sense has often more to do than education,
in making a polished man.</p>

<p>One of the essential qualities of good-breeding, is
deserving general esteem by one's deportment.</p>

<p>In little social games, a malicious girl will sometimes
amuse herself by imposing on a companion a
forfeit that will make her ridiculous; this shows a
bad disposition of mind as well as ill-breeding.</p>

<p>If, in offering a lady a gift, you select one that is
very costly, you may be guilty of an impertinence.</p>

<p>To speak in society of private matters, is extremely
improper.</p>

<p>Turning up the sleeves on sitting down to table, as
some persons do, is gross in the highest degree.</p>

<p>A habit of swearing always marks a vulgar man.</p>

<p>Calling to the waiter with a loud voice in a public-room,
and striking violently on the table, are indicative
of extreme ignorance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>A snuff-taker should not take out his box at table;
his neighbor will be little pleased at receiving the
stray grains in his plate.</p>

<p>Indiscreet questions are impertinent, as well as unseasonable
harangues.</p>

<p>You should be ready to act the knight, if a lady in
your company is attacked. If she give offence, and
that without reason, your office is that of mediator.
You should even ask pardon for your companion. A
bully would act otherwise; but it is absurd to get
into a quarrel for the sake of maintaining that a person
who is insolent has a right to be so, and that because
he is of your company. You will show yourself, in
acting thus, as ill-bred as he.</p>

<p>If, in doing an obliging act, you make people feel
the obligation, you deprive it entirely of its value.</p>

<p>If you speak of a friend to a person who is not intimate
with both him and you, preface his name with
the word Mr. It would not be proper to say to a
servant or a porter, "Is Julius here?" You must
say, "Is Mr. Julius here?"</p>

<p>A servant who understands propriety, always
speaks of his superiors in the third person.</p>

<p>When you receive a present, it would be an offence
to the donor to dismiss the porter without a gratuity.</p>

<p>If the honor of a woman be attacked, you should
always defend it. It is not allowable for any one to
assail the reputation of a lady, even if she be open to
censure.</p>

<p>In walking with a lady in the street, leave her the
inner side of the pavement. If you meet friends in a
narrow passage, or on a footpath, be careful not to
block up the way. It would be very impolite to inconvenience
the passers-by in this manner.</p>

<p>In whatever society you are, it is unpardonable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
remain covered in the presence of a lady. Louis
XIV., going one day on foot out of the castle of Versailles,
uncovered before a vender of cakes who was
stationed near the gate. The courtiers having expressed
their surprise; "Gentlemen," said the monarch,
"is not the king's mother a woman?" Our readers
may also remember the incident related of Henry
Clay: a negro woman courtesied to him, when he
raised his hat politely to her in return. "What!"
said a friend, "do you recognize negroes?" The noble
reply was: "I never allow negroes to excel me
in good manners."</p>

<p>When your visitor retires, you should accompany
him to the anteroom, and save him the trouble of
opening the door. In the case of a lady or an old
gentleman, it is proper to go to the foot of the staircase.</p>
<hr class="chap" />


<h2>THE FORMULA OF INTRODUCTIONS.</h2>


<p>We shall say only a few words about presentations.
The same form is always observed, "Let me
introduce to you Mr. B.;" or, "Mr. Jones, allow me
to present to you Mr. Smith;" or, "I have the honor to
present to you my intimate friend." Introduce no
person until you are sure it is agreeable to <i>both</i> parties.
Ladies should always be asked if they wish to
know Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash; ere he is presented to them. The rule
<i>invariably</i> is, to introduce gentlemen <i>to</i> ladies&mdash;<i>not</i>
ladies <i>to</i> gentlemen. Or, in case of men to men, always
present the younger <i>to</i> the older&mdash;the lesser <i>to</i>
the greater. We Americans, in our disregard of rank
and position, are too apt to overlook the courtesies
established among gentlemen. The person thus
presented bows, the host repeats the oft-spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
compliment, and, with a graceful rejoinder, the ceremony
concludes.</p>

<p>Both ladies and gentlemen should be careful about
introducing persons to each other, without being first
satisfied that such a course will be mutually agreeable.</p>

<p>The custom in this country, particularly among
gentlemen, of indiscriminate introductions, is carried
to such a ridiculous extent, that it has often been
made the subject of comment by foreigners, who can
discover no possible advantage in being made acquainted
with others with whom they are not likely
to associate for three minutes, in whom they take not
the slightest interest, and whom they probably will
never again encounter, nor recognize if they should.
Besides, every one has a right to exercise his own
judgment and taste in the selection of acquaintances,
and it is clearly a breach of politeness to thrust them
upon your friend or associate, without knowing
whether it Will be agreeable to either party.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ON DRESS AND ORNAMENTS.</h2>


<p>A man is judged of by his appearance, and seldom
incorrectly. A neat exterior, equally free from extravagance
and poverty, always proclaims a right-minded
and sensible man. To dress appropriately,
and with good taste, is to respect yourself and others.</p>

<p>A black coat and trowsers are indispensable for a
visit of ceremony, an entertainment, an evening party,
or a ball. The white or black vest is equally proper
in any of these cases. <i>Very ceremonious</i> visits require
a dress shoe and a white vest. The hand should always
be gloved on such occasions. Always wear
kids in dancing. A gentleman, when in dress and
out of his business, should also walk out gloved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
One hand may be uncovered; the one you will extend
if you meet an acquaintance.</p>

<p>If it be not well-bred for a gentleman out of business
hours to appear in the street or at church without
gloves, it is still less so for a lady.</p>

<p>Rings and heavy gold chains are <i>not</i> in good taste.
Some young persons, of both sexes, have a strong desire
to sport gold and jewels; but let them remember
that such is the taste of gamblers and courtesans,
and they may realize how really vulgar is too much
jewelry.</p>

<p>To a woman, the toilet is indeed a study, to which
she should devote a proper portion of her time; and,
sure of being well-skilled in the art, she is impatient of
the observations of the critic. All do not, however,
escape the charge of vulgarity. We sometimes see
dresses in which the ill-assorted or showy colors spoil
the effect of the richest material. The various articles
of dress must be well-chosen, so as to produce an
agreeable <i>harmony</i>. Never put on a dark-colored
bonnet with a light, spring costume. Avoid uniting
colors which will suggest an epigram&mdash;such as a
straw-colored dress, with a green bonnet. [Of the
last-named style of head-gear you must especially beware,
unless you have an extremely fair complexion;
otherwise your malicious rivals will assert that your
face resembles a citron, surrounded by its foliage.]
The arrangements of the hair is an important affair.
Bands are becoming to faces of a Grecian cast&mdash;while
ringlets better suit those lively and expressive
heads which resemble the beautiful Ninon. But,
whatever be your style of countenance, avoid a cumbrous
edifice of lace mixed with hair, and let your
flowers be few and choice. A spray or two of heath,
the delicate blossoms of the jessamine, violets&mdash;orange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
blossoms, a white rose&mdash;these simple ornaments are
most suitable to a young girl, and even of these she
should not be too prodigal, for beauty <i>unadorned</i> is
adorned the most.</p>

<p>In a married woman, a richer style of ornament is
admissible. Feathers in her bonnet, a necklace, a
camellia or jewels in her hair are allowable in the
wife, but for a young girl, a style of modest simplicity
is far more impressive and becoming. We
shall state what is known to be a fact, when we say
ladies who attract most observation, are those dressed
with the most studied simplicity, while those with
most ornament are treated with less deference, and
excite less compliment.</p>

<p>An important maxim to be observed is, that the
most elegant dress loses its merit, if it is not worn
with grace. Young girls often have an air of constraint,
and their dress seems to partake of their want
of ease. The celebrated Sappho is said to have attended
to the arrangement even of the folds of her
mantle. She is indeed fortunate, who can give an
easy flexibility to her figure, and graceful movements
to her head: she will always appear graceful and
well-dressed.</p>

<p>There are women whose dress is extravagant&mdash;folly
of this kind should be avoided: a simple style of
dress is ever <i>proof</i> of modesty, and one never loses by
appearing to be modest.</p>

<p>For many valuable recipes for the toilet, and hints
and suggestions in reference to the complexion, the
hair, the teeth, etc., see "<span class="smcap">Beadle's Dime Recipe
Book</span>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>




<h2>ON CLEANLINESS.</h2>


<p>If there be one thing that we should recommend
more than another, it is cleanliness. We might, indeed,
abstain from this caution, upon the supposition
that the reader can not stand in need of it. But, to
clear our conscience, we devote a chapter to the subject.
The hands should receive special attention, as
they serve for a specimen of the rest. Every morning
wash them with plenty of soap and water, then
with the brush, clean your nails, cut them, and beware
of the dark crescent which gets the name of
half-mourning; nothing can be more disgusting. Let
your face and neck be clean; we particularly recommend
attention to the ears.</p>

<p>Rinse your mouth often; in the morning, to remove
the impurities of the night; after dinner, to avoid making
others acquainted with the meats you have partaken
of; and at night, before retiring to rest, that
you may sleep more sweetly. If you are given to the
really filthy habit of using tobacco, in <i>any</i> shape,
<i>never</i> appear in any social circle, or to any friend for
whom you have any respect, with the <i>odor</i> of the
stuff about you. Let your use of it be as much in secret
as possible. No gentleman will ever smoke a
cigar where its smoke can give the least offence. In
Boston smoking is positively prohibited in the streets:
it should be in every city.</p>

<p>Frequent baths are absolutely necessary, and still
more, frequent foot-baths, with tepid water and soap;
for the dust that one acquires in walking, changes its
name at the end of three days, and in making a call,
your friends will be aware of your presence before
they have seen you. Let your hat and clothes be
carefully brushed.</p>

<p>Nothing is more disagreeable in either sex, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
soiled shoes or stockings. It shows either great negligence
or uncleanliness. Let your linen be perfectly
white, and your dress spotless.</p>

<p>How often do we see women walking in the street
with a torn or frayed dress, or a <i>broken</i> stocking.
Idleness alone is the cause of such things; it is <i>so</i>
easy to stop a rent, and certainly it can not be said
that thread is dear.</p>

<p>A dress ever so simple, and cheap, if it be neat, is
preferable to finery and dirt: one is respectable, the
other is not.</p>

<p>In the pocket-handkerchief great nicety should be
observed, both from regard to appearances, and for
the sake of personal comfort. It should be white
and always clean. A dirty handkerchief is an abomination.
A drop of perfume on it will make it all
the pleasanter to yourself and to others.</p>

<p>Perfect cleanliness in <i>all</i> things gives one a feeling
of self-respect. It not only affords an agreeable sensation
of comfort, but imparts an air of confidence,
springing from the consciousness that you need not
fear the investigations or ridicule of any who approach
you. It will procure you an acquittal for many little
defects of heart, or mind, or temper, and win you
respect where you may least expect to make a favorable
impression.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CONVERSATION.</h2>


<p>It is rare to meet with persons who can converse
agreeably; and yet how many kinds of talkers there
are in the world. First comes the man who details
his own adventures, bringing in even his boyish escapades,
in order to keep up the continuous discharge;
the gastronomic talker, who regales you with a description
of famous dishes; the detailer of empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
trifles; the exquisite Leander of every hysterical
dame; the universal grumbler, who sees nothing of
the sun but its spots; the self-constituted reporter of
every kind of scandal; with many others too numerous
to mention.</p>

<p>If you wish to make yourself agreeable to a lady,
turn the conversation adroitly upon taste, or art, or
books, or persons, or events of the day. Make her
smile&mdash;suffer her to be superior in any encounter of
wit&mdash;and she will pronounce you "the most charming
of men." You will have shown yourself clever and
well-bred. Never seem studied in your phrases, nor
talk above the comprehension or contrary to the taste
of the person addressed, otherwise you may be voted
either a pedant or a bore.</p>

<p>The woman who wishes her conversation to be
agreeable will avoid conceit or affectation, and laughter
which is not natural and spontaneous. Her language
will be easy and unstudied, marked by a graceful
carelessness, which, at the same time, never oversteps
the limits of propriety. Her lips will readily yield to
a pleasant smile; she will not love to hear herself
talk; her tones will bear the impress of sincerity, and
her eyes kindle with animation, as she speaks. The
art of pleasing is, in truth, the very soul of good-breeding;
for the precise object of the latter is to
render us agreeable to all with whom we associate:
to make us, at the same time, esteemed and loved.</p>

<p>We need scarcely advert to the rudeness of interrupting
any one who is speaking, or to the impropriety
of pushing, to its full extent, a discussion which
has become unpleasant.</p>

<p>Some men have a mania for Greek and Latin quotations;
this is a peculiarity to be avoided. Nothing
is more wearisome than pedantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>If you feel your intellectual superiority to any one
with whom you are conversing, do not seek to bear
him down; it would be an inglorious triumph and a
breach of good manners. Beware, too, of speaking
lightly of subjects which bear a sacred character. No
person, man or woman, will think the more of you
for irreligious expression.</p>

<p>Witlings occasionally gain a reputation in society;
but nothing is more insipid and in worse taste than
their conceited harangues and self-sufficient air. Do
<small>NOT TRY</small> to be witty. True wit comes spontaneously,
and is not forced.</p>

<p>It is a common idea that the art of writing and the
art of conversation are one; this is a great mistake.
A man of genius may be a very dull talker.</p>

<p>The two grand modes of making conversation interesting,
are to enliven it by recitals calculated to
affect and impress your hearers, and to intersperse it
with anecdotes and agreeable relations.</p>

<h2>ADDRESS OF LETTERS, DIRECTIONS FOR WRITING, ETC.</h2>


<p>A letter addressed to a person of eminence should
have a seal on the envelope; for other letters the ordinary
envelope is sufficient. Letter paper (other
than for business) with designs of any kind is in questionable
taste, as are seals ornamented with flowers
and figures. Perfectly plain paper should be preferred:
it may be embossed with the writer's initials.
On the birth-days of your relations, and on the festival
of the New Year, you can hardly dispense with
written congratulations.</p>

<p>In writing to a superior employ paper of full "letter"
size; write the name, and in the line underneath
the words, "Dear Sir." Leave a line between this
word and the first line of your letter. Always write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to the point&mdash;using not a superfluous or meaningless
word, and be as brief as possible. Abbreviations are
admissible in notes entered in a book of reference,
but not elsewhere, except in commercial correspondence.</p>

<p>Letters of invitation and circulars should always be
franked; and if the distance be not too great, they
should be sent by hand.</p>

<p>A letter given to a third person, if it be a letter of
introduction, should <i>not</i> be sealed.</p>

<p>In writing to an official, leave a large margin, for
he may need it for marginal notes.</p>

<p>A young man writing to one advanced in years,
should not conclude his letter with the common
phrase, "Receive, sir, the assurance of my regard."
It should be, "Accept, sir, this expression of the regards
of your very humble servant."</p>

<p>This formula may be employed in writing to an
equal, "Accept, sir, the assurance of my highest esteem;"
or, "I have the honor to be yours, very
truly."</p>

<p>To a lady, "Accept, madam, the assurance of my
respect;" or, "I am, my dear lady, yours very sincerely."</p>

<p>It is ill-bred to write on a half-sheet; the shortest
letter requires a whole one.</p>

<p>All letters must be pre-paid. And stamps should
<i>always</i> be remitted, where an answer is expected, if
your own affairs are concerned. Never impose postage
upon a friend: it is a contemptible act to make a
person, after the trouble of writing to you on your
business, pay his own postage.</p>

<p>A few words on epistolary style. Few persons
know how to write a good letter. The epistolary
style, in general, should be very simple; pathos would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
be absurd where you have to speak of the common
occurrences of life, the follies of the world, its petty
hatreds and vanities. Be as respectful and as lively
as you can in writing to an old man: old people love
sprightliness. The surest way to please in your correspondence
is to acquaint yourself with the characters
of the persons with whom you interchange letters,
to avoid touching their foibles, to speak to them
on the subjects they have studied, or of which they
are especially fond. In addressing a lady, imply
your opinion of her taste by seeking her advice on
subjects which require it. Never weary of burning
incense; there is an altar in the heart of woman, and
even of man, always ready to receive its fragrance.
The design of good-breeding is to make you agreeable
to every one; write your letters so that each one
reading them will be pleased and satisfied. Adulation
or flattery is very unbecoming, except it is positively
deserved; and then it should be given in terms
which will not compromise good taste and good
judgment.</p>

<p>If there be a phrase happily worded in the letter
addressed to you, ever so little, do not suffer it to fall
to the ground; preserve it, and in your reply, show
that you have appreciated it.</p>

<p>If a correspondent uses improper language toward
you, let your reply be polite, even if it is severe;
you will thus inflict a double wound&mdash;showing yourself
to be a man of dignity, and know how to preserve
your self-respect.</p>

<p>Refrain from addressing extravagant praise to a
man of discernment; he will see that you have some
purpose in what you say, and you will make an
enemy. No praise is extravagant to fools; tell them
that they are gods, and they will set about procuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
an altar; but you would view yourself with contempt
if you were mean enough to praise such.</p>

<p>Avoid the folly of copying, <i>as models</i>, letters to
which peculiar circumstances impart brilliancy or
genuine wit; but which, applied from different cases,
are strangely out of place.</p>

<p>If you address one beneath you in education or position,
don't make him feel his inferiority; be polite without
familiarity, as politeness is <i>due</i> from every man of
good parts to those beneath him.</p>

<p>If you write an epistle respecting a common occurrence
in a style of bombast or would-be-eloquence,
you will suggest an application to yourself of the
fable of the mountain which brought forth a mouse.</p>

<p>In all cases, where it is possible, avoid erasures and
crowded lines.</p>

<p>Letters between friends are simply conversation;
from an inferior to a superior they should have a tone
of caution, at once concise and respectful. A letter
of business is expressed in brief and precise terms,
with details arranged in exact order. Letters of congratulation
should be distinguished for choice language,
to the exclusion of all expressions parasitical or common-place.
As to the style which a son should employ
in writing to his parents, there is no instructor
but the heart. In every case and circumstance be
truthful and earnest, and you may rest assured
you will impress favorably, and accomplish your purpose
a thousandfold better than if you used deceitful
and false expressions.</p>

<h2>BALLS, EVENING-PARTIES, RECEPTIONS, ETC.</h2>


<p>To deport oneself satisfactorily at the dance, it is
necessary to understand much about the dances which
may be introduced. It is a charming accomplishment
to be a good dancer, and we shall not hesitate to
advise all, male and female, to learn the Terpsichorean
art, ere the days of youth are past. It is unnecessary
to argue the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of the proprieties and moralities
of the dance; we prefer to let each judge for
him or herself on the debated question; but, that it
is a real accomplishment, and a desirable one, to be
familiar with the etiquette and technicalities of the
ball or soiree, is our most firm conviction, and we
therefore introduce such observations and rules here
as should govern the occasions of balls, soirees, receptions,
etc.</p>

<p>An invitation to a dance should be given at least a
week beforehand. A lady sometimes requires time
to prepare her toilet. The host of the house receives
you; and after the usual compliments, which should
be very brief, do not fail in polite recognitions to any
lady in the company with whom you are acquainted.
If you introduce a friend, make him acquainted with
the names of the chief persons present; by this precaution
you will often save him an indiscretion; and
make him feel more at his ease. These ball-room
introductions are <i>not</i> regarded as introductions for a
more extended acquaintance than for the evening.
Should the parties afterward meet upon the street or
elsewhere, let the gentleman be careful not to presume
upon any recognition of the lady until <i>she</i> has <i>first</i>
bowed. If she fails to extend this recognition, let the
gentleman take no umbrage, for he has no real claim
upon her acquaintance merely from a public ball-room
introduction. An introduction at a <i>private</i> soiree is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
another thing; there the relations of the parties introduced
are the same as at any private party: they are
<i>permanently</i> introduced if at all.</p>

<p>If a gentleman escorts a lady to the dance, he is
her cavalier for the evening; he must see that she is
always provided with agreeable partners; that she
always has a seat when required; has the necessary
refreshments, etc. He must dance with her <i>first</i> of
all, and as often, during the evening, as is proper,
considering the claims of others and the wishes of
the lady.</p>

<p>Avoid seeking the same partner (other than your
lady <i>en charge</i>) in the dance too often; you will
excite remark, and will expose yourself to the charge
of partiality or perhaps of coquetry. It is a graceful
attention in a young man to select as partners those
ladies whose want of personal attractions condemn
them to the terrible punishment of being the "wall-flowers"
of the evening. Such attentions will procure
you a feeling of grateful regard, especially if you acquit
yourself with tact and real kindness.</p>

<p>If a married lady is present, and dancing while her
husband is in the room, a person desiring her for a
partner should first <i>be sure</i> that it is agreeable to the
husband for him to offer his hand to the lady.</p>

<p>If a crowd is present, and a gentleman has occasion
to make his way through a press of crinoline and
drapery, he should proceed most carefully&mdash;haste
would be very rude and inexcusable; the danger of
soiling, or tearing, or disarranging a lady's costume
forbids any gentleman making a careless step.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to step in front of a lady in passing,
always apologize for the step; otherwise she may
very properly think you do not know what belongs
to good manners. A lady is always <i>pleased</i> with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<i>apology</i> if it is gracefully and kindly made; and no
gentleman will ever suffer such an occasion to pass in
silence, without he really designs an affront, or except
he is absolutely ignorant of what is proper and respectful.</p>

<p>A good authority before us says:&mdash;In a quadrille,
or other dance, while awaiting the music, or while
unengaged, a lady and gentleman should avoid long
conversations, as they are apt to interfere with the
progress of the dance; while, on the other hand, a
gentleman should not stand like an automaton, as
though he were afraid of his partner, but endeavor to
render himself agreeable by those "airy nothings"
which amuse for the moment, and are in harmony
with the occasion. You should, however, not only
on such occasions, but invariably, avoid the use of
<i>slang</i> terms and phrases, they being, to the last degree,
vulgar and objectionable. Indeed, one of the charms
of conversation consists in the correct use of language.
Dr. Johnson, whose reputation as a <i>talker</i> was hardly
less than that which he acquired as a writer, prided
himself on the appositeness of his quotations, the
choice of his words, and the correctness of his expressions.
Had he lived in this "age of progress," he
would have discovered that his Lexicon was not only
incomplete, but required numerous emendations. We
can fancy the irritable moralist endeavoring to comprehend
the idea which a young lady wishes to convey,
when she expresses the opinion that a bonnet is
"<i>awful</i>," or a young gentleman of his coat, when he
asserts that it is "<i>played out</i>!" If any one thing
marks a person's "bringing up," it is the language
used in company; and it may be set down as an
almost invariable rule, that any one who uses <i>slang</i>
words, who talks loudly and rudely, who utters an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
oath, or who becomes angered and expresses it, is <i>no</i>
gentleman, and has not had good associations. For
a <i>lady</i> to be guilty of even one of these sins, is too palpably
inexcusable to need remark.</p>

<p>The author quoted above, adds this excellent advice
upon a very common ball-room sin, viz.: scandal and
strictures upon a person's appearance, dress, etc. He
says:&mdash;"There is a custom which is sometimes practiced
both in the assembly-room and at private parties,
which can not be too strongly reprehended,&mdash;we allude
to the habit of ridicule and ungenerous criticism of
those who are ungraceful, or otherwise obnoxious to
censure, which is indulged in by the thoughtless, particularly
among the dancers. Of its gross impropriety
and vulgarity we need hardly express an opinion;
but there is such an utter disregard for the feelings of
others implied in this kind of negative censorship, that
we can not forbear to warn our young readers to
avoid it. The 'Koran' says: 'Do not mock&mdash;the
mocked may be better than the mocker.' Those you
condemn may not have had the same advantages as
yourself in acquiring grace or dignity, while they may
be infinitely superior in purity of heart and mental
accomplishments. The advice of Chesterfield to his
son, in his commerce with society, to <i>do as you would
be done by</i>, is founded on the Christian precept, and
worthy of commendation. Imagine yourself the victim
of others' ridicule, and you will cease to indulge
in a pastime which only gains for you the hatred of
those you satirize, if they chance to observe you, and
the contempt of others who have noticed your violation
of politeness, and abuse of true sociality."</p>

<p>Ladies will always be careful of their associates.
At the public ball are occasionally to be found persons
whose acquaintance it is not proper to make. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
young female is ever the cynosure of all eyes, and can
not comport herself too strictly, nor choose her partners
too carefully. It is not best to be "prudish,"
but it is right and necessary to be cautious and discreet.</p>

<p>In walking up or down the room the lady should
always be accompanied by a gentleman; it is quite
improper to saunter around alone.</p>

<p>When a young lady declines dancing with a gentleman,
it is her duty to give him a reason why, although
some thoughtless ones do not. No matter how frivolous
it may be, it is simply an act of courtesy to offer
him an excuse; while, on the other hand, no gentleman
ought so far to compromise his self-respect as to
take the slightest offence at seeing a lady by whom
he has just been refused, dance immediately after with
some one else. A lady has a hundred motives for
conduct which she can not explain; and for a gentleman
to take offence at her simple declination to dance
is very silly and unmanly.</p>

<p>During the act of dancing all parties should have
on their summer looks. Dancing is rightly supposed
to be an <i>enjoyment</i>, but the somber countenances of
some who engage in it, might almost lead to the belief
that it were a solemn duty being performed. If,
says a shrewd observer, those who laugh in church
would transfer their merriment to the assembly-room,
and those who are sad in the assembly-room would
carry their gravity to the church, they both might
discover the appositeness of Solomon's declaration,
that "there is a time to be merry and a time to be
sad."</p>

<p>It should ever be the study of both sexes to render
themselves agreeable. Gentlemen, as we have said,
should avoid showing <i>marked</i> preference to particular
ladies, by devoting their undivided attentions to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
or dancing exclusively with them. Too often, the
"belle of the evening," with no other charms than
beauty of form and feature, monopolizes the regards
of a circle of admirers, while modest merit, of less
personal attraction, is both overlooked and neglected.
We honor the generous conduct of those, particularly
the "well-favored," who bestow their attentions on
ladies who, from conscious lack of beauty, least expect
them. The real man of sense will not fail to recognize
most solicitously any lady who may seem neglected
or unattended.</p>

<p>On the other hand, no lady, however numerous the
solicitations of her admirers, should consent to dance
repeatedly when, by so doing, she excludes other
ladies from participating in the same amusement; still
less, as we have hinted, should she dance exclusively
with the same gentleman, to the disadvantage of
others.</p>

<p>What has elsewhere been said in regard to dress
and ornament will apply fully to the occasion of the
dance. Let <i>simplicity</i> be the guide, and not display.
The lady tricked out in many jewels and ribbons
looks too much like a moving advertisement to command
respect for it. If ladies generally knew how
deep an impression a pure style of dress makes upon
the other sex, and realized how trifling a gaudy dress
seems to the person of true taste, we surmise their
vanity alone would impel to simpler attire, rather
than to elaborate and costly display.</p>

<p>In regard to a gentleman's dress for the dance, we
may add: white gloves, white vest, light colored cravat,
dress-coat, black pants, and patent-leather gaiters,
or light calf-skin boots well polished, constitute the
proper ball-room or soiree costume. The much
talked of "independence" of Americans, professes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
disdain of many of the requisitions of dress established
by good usage in England and France. A <i>frock</i>-coat
would not be tolerated a moment in any fashionable
society in Europe. Whether it be esteemed a prejudice
or otherwise, we are free to confess that, in our
own opinion, the frock-coat is a violation of good
taste, as unsuited either to a ball-room or private
assembly. The ordinary dress-coat, which is in no
respect in the way, and which leaves the limbs perfectly
free to move gracefully, is the only proper coat
for the party and dance.</p>

<p>When a lady has accepted refreshment, her attending
gentleman should hasten to relieve her of her
glass or plate; and, as her cavalier, should see that
all her wants and wishes have been complied with.
The refreshments over, the gentleman should offer his
arm and gallant the lady to her seat in the ball-room;
or, if she wishes to retire to the dress-room, he should
gallant her to the door, and there await her coming
out to convey her to the dancing-floor again. The
ladies dressing-room, it is unnecessary to say, is a
sacred precinct into which no man should ever presume
to look; to go into it would be an outrage
which none could overlook or forgive.</p>

<p>When the hour comes for retiring home, be sure
to be ready for the lady whom you have accompanied
to the dance; your obligations are not discharged
until she is again, under your own eyes, seen safely at
her own door. If you have come to the room unattended,
select, during the latter part of the evening,
some lady who, it may seem, will be glad of your
company home; offer her your services and, if she
signifies assent, be careful to be ready at her call.
Await at the door of the dressing-room for her, and
offering your arm do the gallant kindly but not ostentatiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
nor too officiously. Leave her at her own door,
after the bell has been answered, and not until then.</p>

<p>In leaving an evening-party it is unnecessary to
seek the master of the house. Your farewell will be
dispensed with; you should leave without disturbing
any one to occasion remark. This rule is often misunderstood,
but it should not be.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CARDS, CHESS, ETC.</h2>


<p>It is well at a ball, to have a table for cards and
men for chess: for all the guests are not dancers, and
it is the duty of a host to see that <i>all</i> enjoy themselves.
It is customary for partners to bow slightly
to each other before beginning a game of cards or
chess. When a game of cards is ended, and the
"shuffle" is your partner's, the cards should be arranged
and handed to the lady whose turn it is to
deal them.</p>

<p>To discuss the rules of play is ungenteel. In a
quiet party the tact and cordiality of the entertainers
should put all the guests at their ease.</p>

<p>The choice of the guests is not one of the least
difficult points. At the house of a political man,
there should be an effort to unite all shades of opinion.
From parties of any kind, a man known for
his gratuitous rudeness, or for the impropriety of his
witticism, will be excluded by all who are desirous of
maintaining the proprieties of social intercourse. Opposing
politicians, editors, lawyers, and ministers
should <i>never</i> carry their <i>professional</i> feelings into the
parlor, nor, by any expression, mar the good-humor
of an evening.</p>

<p>It is improper to express your opinion loudly in
company, or to remain long at the card-table when
you are young and known to be a good dancer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a delicate attention to stand behind a lady at
the piano and turn over the leaves of her music-book,
and after the music to gallant her to her seat. After
the dance, a gentleman must not omit to conduct his
partner to her seat; and in so doing, a well-turned
compliment will not be out of place.</p>

<p>We have noted the impropriety of a young man's
remaining long at the chess or the card table, when
the ladies are in want of a partner in the adjoining
room. At the same time, a gentleman should be acquainted
with one or more games, as it is polite to
play with the host or his guests, if you are invited to
do so.</p>

<p>Some persons, in playing cards, show an effort to
conceal their hand; this is ill-bred. If it be a pleasure
to spectators to watch the game, why should you
object to it? Even if it be disagreeable to you to be
overlooked, you should not let it appear.</p>

<p>You will sometimes see one partner reproach another
sharply for unskillful play; thus convicting
himself of being more unskilled in the science of
good-breeding.</p>

<p>The man who utters noisy complaints about his
luck, or manifests unseemly joy at winning a game,
raising his voice to a high key on all occasions, is so
ignorant as to be unworthy of admission into a drawing-room.</p>

<p>In playing chess, avoid the other extreme of being
too silent and abstracted, for such conduct is only
fit for the study.</p>

<p>Use a cheerful air, and make others feel your geniality,
if you would win hearts as well as games.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>




<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ENTERTAINMENTS, DINNER-PARTIES, ETC.</h2>


<p>"To give an invitation," says a brilliant writer, "is
to take the responsibility of your guest's happiness
during the time he is under your roof." This is an
ambitious view of the subject; we will alter it thus:
"To invite a man, is to undertake to do all in your
power to make him feel satisfied with the pleasure
you offer him." In order to do which, it is essential
to know the tastes of your guests. To invite two
persons at enmity with each other, to an entertainment,
is a blunder; it is unpardonable to bring such
together in a small party, unless, indeed, the way to
reconciliation lies open; and even in this case there
is an awkwardness in the presence of enemies, which
will not fail to render their presence unpleasant to
others.</p>

<p>"The pleasures of the table," says the author of
the "Physiology of Taste," "belong to all ages, to all
ranks, to all countries; they may be enjoyed with all
other pleasures, and remain the longest to console us
for their loss." That this enjoyment may be undisturbed,
take care that nothing occurs to chagrin any
of the guests; if, therefore, the conversation falls
upon a subject disagreeable to any one present, good-breeding
requires that the host should skillfully turn
it upon another topic.</p>

<p>An invitation to dinner should be given at least
two days beforehand, except in extraordinary cases.
From an inferior to a superior, it should be made in
person.</p>

<p>In ceremonious dinners, the place of each guest is
assigned beforehand; you thus avoid putting several
ladies together. Each one should have a gentleman
next her.</p>

<p>The host offers his arm to the lady deserving of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
most consideration. Young people should yield to
those more advanced in years. Do not forget, in
passing the threshold of a door, to <i>precede</i> the lady
who leans on your arm. This is an exception to the
general rule; in every other case, the gentleman
should retire a step, to allow the lady to pass.</p>

<p>Before passing into the dining-room, each gentleman
offers his <i>left</i> arm to a lady, and conducts her to
table.</p>

<p>Beware of arriving too early or too late: in either
case there is an awkwardness&mdash;in the former you inconvenience
your host; in the latter, his guests.</p>

<p>Once at table, you should not lose sight of the
plate or glass of your fair neighbor, showing yourself
attentive, without affectation or over-officiousness.</p>

<p>Meat should be cut only according as it is carried
to the mouth. To cut up a plateful is the very
height of greediness and ill-breeding.</p>

<p>Bread is broken as it is wanted; after soup, which
is served out by the host, the spoon remains on the
plate, as it will not be used again.</p>

<p>Where wine is used, three glasses are usually laid
down to each guest at dinner: one for ordinary wines;
another of smaller size for claret; the third to receive
the sparkling foam of the champagne. In drinking
you should say to your neighbor, "Sir, may I offer
you?" and not employ the ungenteel phrase, "Will
you take?" as if you were at the bar of some ordinary
drinking-saloon.</p>

<p>If the dish that you desire be too far from your
neighbor, do not ask another guest; the servant will
attend your orders.</p>

<p>The noise of the knife and plate should be heard
as little as possible; rapidity in eating is also ill-bred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>A knowledge of carving is indispensable to all men
who would act the host with grace and propriety.</p>

<p>Do not assist yourself to any dish where servants
stand ready to supply you.</p>

<p>Some persons use their bread at dinner to dry up
their plates; this is intolerable beyond the family
circle, and even there is rather childish.</p>

<p>Parents should be careful to save their children
from awkwardness in company, either in treading on
a lady's dress, or using the knife in eating; or worse
still, their fingers.</p>

<p>Never take any thing out of your pocket to lay on
the table.</p>

<p>The napkin should rest on the knees, only half unfolded.
The fork is never to be laid on its back.</p>

<p>The host has the knives changed for dessert.</p>

<p>The knife and fork, and the table utensils generally
should never be handed endways, but should be
held by the middle.</p>

<p>Coffee is generally served after passing into the
drawing room. The lady of the house fills it out if
it be after dinner; after breakfast this office may be
left to a servant.</p>

<p>The hostess should not seek to outvie her guests
in the costliness of her toilet. This would be in bad
taste.</p>

<p>In England, it is the custom for ladies to retire a
little before the close of the meal. American ladies
are not disposed to admire this habit, and we are too
gallant and too anxious to enjoy the charm of their
conversation, to subject them to this mode of banishment.</p>

<p>The lady of the house should show the same solicitude
for all her guests, and take care that they want
for nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>In some houses, a custom has been adopted, which
appears to us vulgar, viz: the gentlemen retire from
the company for a short time <i>to smoke</i>; on their return
to the ladies, their clothes and breath exhale the
disagreeable perfume. There are few well-bred women
to whom tobacco is not extremely offensive.</p>

<p>The host rises to leave the table; you must remember
not to fold your napkin, as is usual in the family,
where the same napkin serves you several times.
Each gentleman offers his arm to a lady, and conducts
her back to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The Romans knew how to enhance, by enjoyments
unknown to us, the pleasures of the table; and the
Greeks threw more poetry into their festivals than
our somewhat prosaic eaters. At the banquets of
Greece, the sculptured cups were crowned with
roses; singers and musicians enlivened the close of
the repast; and the wit of the professed jester contributed
to the entertainment of the guests.</p>

<p>The table and side-board and mantels will always
look more inviting when dressed tastefully in flowers.
A sweet bouquet before each lady is a personal compliment
which it is easy to bestow, and one which
can not fail to please the guests.</p>

<h2>ETIQUETTE OF THE STREET.</h2>


<p>Good behavior upon the street, or public promenade,
marks the gentleman most effectually; rudeness, incivility,
disregard of "what the world says," marks
the person of low breeding. We always know, in
walking a square with a man, if he is a gentleman or
not. A real gentility never does the following things
on the street, in presence of observers:&mdash;</p>

<p>Never picks the teeth, nor scratches the head.</p>

<p>Never swears or talks uproariously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Never picks the nose with the finger.</p>

<p>Never smokes, or spits upon the walk, to the exceeding
annoyance of those who are always disgusted
with tobacco in any shape.</p>

<p>Never stares at any one, man or woman, in a
marked manner.</p>

<p>Never scans a lady's dress impertinently, and makes
no rude remarks about her.</p>

<p>Never crowds before promenaders in a rough or
hurried way.</p>

<p>Never jostles a lady or gentleman without an "excuse
me."</p>

<p>Never treads upon a lady's dress without begging
pardon.</p>

<p>Never loses temper, nor attracts attention by excited
conversation.</p>

<p>Never dresses in an odd or singular manner, so as
to create remark.</p>

<p>Never fails to raise his hat politely to a lady acquaintance;
nor to a male friend who may be walking
with a lady&mdash;it is a courtesy to the lady.</p>

<p>Of course a lady will not be rude, nor dress so as
attract undue attention, much less to create unpleasant
remark. She will be kind to all; she will not absorb
too much of the walk, nor fail to give half the way to
either a lady or gentleman; she will not allow her
skirts to drag upon the walk to the annoyance of
other pedestrians; she will not fail to recognize friends
by a pleasant smile and slight bow; she will not look
back at any one who has passed her; she will not
eye another lady's dress, as if studying its very texture;
she will not stop upon the walk to talk with a
friend to the inconvenience of others; she will not
make the street a place of meeting with a person
whom she can not receive at her house. Some females<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
do, it is true, not regard all these laws of proper
and recognized etiquette; and such, we are forced to
say, forfeit their claim to be called a lady. A true
lady in the street, as in the parlor or <i>salon</i>, is modest,
discreet, kind, obliging; if she is to the contrary, she
forfeits her right to be called after the truly genteel.</p>

<p>It is a most unfailing mark of ignorance and low
origin to "put on airs," and to show pride, vanity,
egotism in the street. The truly well-educated, well-born,
and well-bred <i>never</i> betray vanity, conceit, superciliousness,
nor hauteur. Set this down as an invariable
law, and, male or female, let it guide all your
actions.</p>

<p>It is proper that the lady should <i>first</i> recognize the
gentleman. There has been some dispute on this
point of etiquette, but we think there can be no question
of the propriety of the first recognition coming
from the lady. A gentleman will never fail to bow
in return to a lady, even if he may feel coldly disposed
toward her; but a lady may not feel at liberty
to return a gentleman's bow, which places him in a
rather unpleasant position. A lady should give the
first smile or bow, is the rule now recognized.</p>

<p>In meeting acquaintances several times during the
same promenade, it is not necessary to salute them at
every passing.</p>

<p>In offering a lady your arm, as it is proper to do
upon the street, particularly in the evening, always
give her the <i>right</i> arm, because persons in passing,
observing the law "turn to the right," would jostle
her if she was upon the left arm. The practice of
always giving the lady the inside of the walk, is a
very useless one, and not necessary to true politeness.</p>

<p>It is always proper for a gentleman walking alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
or with another of his sex, to give the lady, or a gentleman
with a lady, the inside of the walk.</p>

<p>In gallanting a lady to a carriage, take her left
hand. It is truly polite to take off the hat in such a
service.</p>

<h2>THE POLITENESS OF BUSINESS.</h2>


<p>A volume might with propriety be written on business
proprieties, for the rules of good-breeding are so
outrageously violated by employees and employers,
that to detail their shortcomings would require many
pages. But in business as in all other intercourse,
the one invariable law of good-breeding, viz.: kindness,
offers the key to all true mode of conduct. Be kind
and considerate, and you will do right.</p>

<p>The upright and model man of business never
commits any of the following sins:&mdash;</p>

<p>Never tells a falsehood, even though at times it
may offer a temporary advantage. In the end it will
not result happily&mdash;neither to conscience nor to the
till. It is one of the fixed laws of compensations that
a wrong entails evil, sooner or later; hence, even in
a selfish view, it is best always to tell the truth.</p>

<p>Never creates false expectations to effect a transaction.</p>

<p>Never represents an article to be what it is not. The
secret of the success of A. T. Stewart, and other merchants
of eminence, is that they never would allow
any deception to be practiced upon customers. A
child can buy of them as safely as an experienced
person.</p>

<p>Never breaks appointments, and never fails to keep
good his word to the hour and the letter, if there is
no just cause to prevent.</p>

<p>Never is absent from his business, except when
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Never allows others in his employ to do what is
not perfectly intelligible to him. Always understands
his books; always keeps the run of the entire day's
transactions; always knows the exact state of his
bank account; always is acquainted with the doings
of each one in his employ.</p>

<p>If called upon by any person he is polite; he gives
no curt answers; he keeps none waiting unnecessarily;
he is solicitous of doing what will most please.</p>

<p>In a word, the secret of business success, and the
true criterion of action for the business man, young
or old, is to be found in that blessed Golden Rule,
which will forever hold good, viz.:&mdash;</p>



<div class='center'><i>Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you.</i></div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ADVICE TO THE WORKING-MAN.</h2>


<p>Let it not be said that the first principles of good
breeding are unknown to the working-man; he may
be ignorant of the usages of society, but he can, if he
please, maintain a becoming and agreeable deportment.
What generally makes him coarse and surly,
is the prejudice, unhappily too widely spread, that
the rich man feels above him. This is a great mistake;
it is not the blouse that is shunned, it is the
rudeness of the man who wears it. Labor is always
held in esteem by any man of sense; but who can
regard coarseness and rudeness with respect? Two
workmen enter a saloon, they talk as if in the street,
abuse those whom they name "aristocrats," and make
such a disturbance, that the waiter shows them to the
door. Is it the working-man who is thus used? no,
verily, it is the insulter of the public. A man in
broadcloth, who should conduct himself thus, would,
in like manner, be requested to retire from the company
of those whom he was disturbing. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the operative thus treated, always exclaims: "Though
one is a workman, he is as good as you." But, in
this case, he is not in the character of a working-man,
but in that of a consumer, like all the others seeking
their comfort or pleasure; none of whom would think
of saying, if such a thing happened to them, "I am a
lawyer;" or, "I am a physician;" or, "I am an
officer." In a public establishment, such as a <i>cafe</i>, or
hotel, or in public conveyances, all are equal, and no
one should be suffered to be insolent, or vulgar, or
rude.</p>

<p>The rich man, on his part, knows that there are
laws of politeness to be observed toward all. The
upstart or snob alone gives himself the habit of speaking
rudely to those he employs; he alone affects to
humble them by his tone of superiority. The man
of <i>true</i> nobility is polite to every one, be he rich or
poor.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LOVE, COURTSHIP, AND MARRIAGE.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></h2>


<p>In the matter of <span class="smcap">Love</span> it would be hard to lay
down any formal rules; the heart is its own teacher;
if <i>its</i> impulses be true and pure, your looks, words,
and actions will be in no danger of doing you any
particular discredit. Even awkwardness is sometimes
eloquent, and makes a better companion than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
most elegant self-possession, since it proclaims the
reality of your passion, and the diffidence of real affection.
Love has a language of its own, and will not
thank any book of etiquette for a lesson. If the
maiden be modest, and the youth sincere and manly,
they will appreciate and understand each other without
danger of mistakes.</p>

<p>It has been said that any refined and delicate
woman can <i>prevent</i> an offer which she does not intend
to accept, and we believe that, in most cases, she can;
saving herself the pain of refusal, and her lover the
mortification of being rejected.</p>

<p>It is a poor triumph for a young lady to say, or to
feel, that she has refused five, ten, or twenty offers of
marriage; it is about the same as acknowledging herself
a trifler and coquette, who, from motives of personal
vanity, tempts and induces hopes and expectations
which she has predetermined shall be disappointed.
Such a course is, to a certain degree, both
unprincipled and immodest.</p>

<p>It is a still greater crime when a man conveys the
impression that he is in love, by actions, gallantries,
looks, attentions, all&mdash;except that he never commits
himself&mdash;and finally withdraws his devotions, exulting
in the thought that he has said or written nothing
which can legally bind him.</p>

<p>But true love, as we remarked before, will find for
itself some becoming expression and&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"needs not the foreign child of ornament."<br />
</div>

<p>Love, of course, unless some insuperable barrier
exists, will be followed in due time by <span class="smcap">Courtship</span>.
Here some formalities will begin to be observed. The
passion which blushed to own itself to itself, having
been crowned, becomes a matter of interest to others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
than the two most particularly concerned. If a young
man thinks fit to address himself <i>first</i> to the young
lady, to find if his attentions be agreeable to her, he
should not delay, after gaining her consent to them,
to respectfully solicit the approval of her parents or
guardians. This is due to them, and should not be
put off on account of any unworthy fear or timidity.</p>

<p>It is customary in some circles for the parents to
make the betrothal immediately known to their friends,
and even to give a kind of preliminary festival at
which the couple are publicly congratulated.</p>

<p>Good taste will dictate the avoidance of any expression
of fondness between the parties when in
company.</p>

<p>Envy and satire are ever on the look-out for subjects
of ridicule, and it is well to give them no opportunity.
Sentiment which is beautiful in the family
circle, is often odious in society. The same rule
holds good with relatives and newly-married people.
Their devotion to each other should be put aside, and
the claims of others upon their courtesy and time duly
honored.</p>

<p>The amount of attention permissible before marriage,
such as walking, driving, concert-going, etc.,
depends very much upon the customs of the place in
which the persons reside. Public opinion and habit
should not be invaded without some good and weighty
reason, even with the most innocent purposes. It
can not be desirable to provoke remark and censure,
however indifferent you may feel towards its authors.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Marriage</span> ceremony varies with the fortunes
and wishes of those interested.</p>

<p>In regard to the form of the rite, no specific direction
are necessary; for those who are to be married
by ministers, will study the form of their particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
church&mdash;the Methodists their "Book of Discipline,"
the Episcopalians their "Book of Common Prayer,"
the Catholics their Ritual, etc., etc. In most cases a
rehearsal of the ceremony is made in private, that the
pair may the more perfectly understand the necessary
forms. If the parties are to be wedded by a magistrate,
the ceremony is almost nominal&mdash;it is a mere
repetition of a vow. The Catholic and Episcopal
forms have the most ceremony, and doubtless are the
most impressive, though no more effectually marrying
than the simplest form.</p>

<p>There are, however, some generally received rules
which govern this momentous and interesting occasion,
and to these we refer all interested.</p>

<p>When the wedding is not strictly in private, it is
customary for bridesmaids and groomsmen to be
chosen to assist in the duties of the occasion.</p>

<p>The bridesmaids should be <i>younger</i> than the bride;
their dresses should be <i>conformed to hers</i>; they should
not be any more expensive, though they are permitted
more ornament. They are generally chosen of light,
graceful material; flowers are the principal decoration.</p>

<p>The bride's dress is marked by simplicity. But
few jewels or ornaments should be worn, and those
should be the gift of the bridegroom or parents. A
veil and garland are the distinguishing features of the
dress.</p>

<p>The bridesmaids assist in dressing the bride, receiving
the company, etc.; and, at the time of the ceremony,
stand at her <i>left</i> side, the first bridesmaid holding
the bouquet and gloves.</p>

<p>The groomsmen receive the clergyman, present him
to the couple to be married, and support the bridegroom
upon the <i>right</i>, during the ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>If it is an evening wedding, at home, immediately
after "these twain are made one," they are congratulated:
first by the relatives, then by the friends, receiving
the good wishes of all; after which, they are
at liberty to leave their formal position, and mingle
with the company. The dresses, supper, etc., are
usually more festive and gay than for a morning
wedding and reception, where the friends stop for a
few moments only, to congratulate the newly-married
pair, taste the cake and wine, and hurry away.</p>

<p>When the ceremony is performed in church, the
bride enters at the <i>left</i>, with her father, mother, and
bridesmaids; or, at all events, with a bridesmaid.
The groom enters at the <i>right</i>, followed by his attendants.
The parents stand behind, the attendants at
either side.</p>

<p>The bride should be certain that her glove is readily
removable; the groom, that the ring is where he
can find it, to avoid delay and embarrassment.</p>

<p>When they leave the church, the newly-married
couple walk arm-in-arm. They have usually a reception
of a couple of hours at home, for their intimate
friends, then a breakfast, then leave upon the "bridal
tour."</p>

<p>The wording of invitations, and the styles of cards,
are so constantly changing, that it will not do to lay
down rules. Cards of invitation <i>to</i> the wedding are
usually sent out in the <i>name of the mother</i>. [See
page 70.]</p>

<p>A few days before the return of the wedded pair,
their own especial card is sent to those whom they
desire shall call upon them, and whose acquaintance
they wish to retain.</p>

<p>However plain the dress chosen for the occasion,
gloves and shoes must be faultless. There should be
flowers if possible; they are never more in place.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The fee of the clergyman will be decided by the
fortune and position of the groom. No doubt, in the
joy of his heart, the just married will be liberal; if
he is not, upon <i>this</i> occasion, he never will be. The
<i>first groomsman</i> will take charge of this matter.</p>

<p>The travelling dresses should not be marked by
"bridal favors," if the happy couple wish to avoid the
curious scrutiny of strangers.</p>

<p>Married people should never intrude "family jars"
nor family devotion upon company. Husband and
wife should be pleasant and affectionate in their demeanor,
with a show of reserve, while in the presence
of "the world." It is improper to say "husband"
and "wife," in speaking of your companion to others.
Use their title, as Mr. or Mrs.&mdash;that is, to all but intimate
friends. Especially, do not introduce, "my
wife," or "my husband." Caresses, disagreements,
and significant glances betraying secret intelligence,
are all out of place in general company.</p>

<p>The "honeymoon" is a mythic time. It is generally
regarded as extending to the first six weeks,
during which period the young couple must give
themselves up to receptions of friends, to attending
parties made in their honor, etc. The real honeymoon
<i>should</i> last <i>through life</i>, and will, if the pair is
properly mated. Therefore, let the choice be made
in no haste and passion and blindness, but in deliberation
and calm exercise of judgment.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> There is much preposterous stuff before the public, in the way of
books relating to love and its relations, to marriage, and to wedded
life. We look upon these works, as a general thing, as vicious in
their nature, because they excite passions and feelings and expectations
of which no one needs to be specially informed; while their
detail of processes necessary to accomplish a wished for "happy
result" are truly disgusting. A person's own heart, and the advice
of some good sensible married friend, are all sufficient for the necessary
guidance of a man or woman designing marriage. We propose,
in some future work, to introduce this matter more fully to our
readers, in a series of papers especially addressed to young and to
married folks. We here give such general rules and observances as
seem proper to be adverted to in a work on etiquette.</p></div></div>




<h2>RESPECT FOR RELIGION AND FOR OLD AGE.</h2>


<p>Some young people seem to imagine that they are
living in the age of Voltaire, and make a merit of skeptical
and even atheistical opinions. They laugh at
the sacred character of the ministry, and deride what
is venerable and sacred. This class is as deserving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of contempt, as it is avoided in truly good society.
Impiety is no longer fashionable as it was in the days
when an atheistical philosopher thought to make laws
for the world, and construe liberty into license to
outrage every pious instinct.</p>

<p>A man who does not respect the religion of his
fathers, is incapable of knowing, and therefore of applying,
the laws of good-breeding. A young man
who boasts his freedom of religious opinions, is but
confessing his own ignorance, for his belief is, in most
cases, the result of a perfect non-acquaintance with
religious systems. How many of our boasted "free
thinkers" are men of pure lives and noble instincts?</p>

<p>Another sin is its want of respect for women and
for persons of advanced years. A man of religious
feeling holds himself bound to those duties, in respect
to old age, that were observed in ancient times. But
the young men of whom we have been speaking
make a parade of rudeness in the presence of an old
man; they pay him no more respect than if he were
an unfledged youth of eighteen like themselves; they
smoke cigars under his nose; scarcely deign to acknowledge
him in the street; and never are willing
to remember that their father is or was an old man,
and that they will themselves grow old. Such respect
neither their parents nor themselves. Diogenes
declared himself to be a dog that he might have a
right to indulge his cynical disposition. So are these
flippant theologians who have sunk to the same level.</p>

<p>One word as to the influence of religion upon the
character of the young girl. A religious course of
training can alone impart to the feminine character
that spirit of yielding gentleness which, in domestic,
as in public life, is the basis of politeness. Deprived
of these qualities, a woman would be unamiable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the family circle, as well as in the world, where, in
spite of her efforts to appear pleasing, her bad education
would inevitably display itself. Young ladies of
this class, if they do not go the length of impertinence,
have a dissatisfied air, and indulge in the habit of criticising
every thing with severity. If married, they
quickly banish peace from the conjugal roof, by their
exactions and ill-humor. They are not willing to
make a single sacrifice for their husband's happiness;
quarrels and oppositions please them, and the gentlest
yoke becomes a heavy chain. The husband thus
situated may consider himself happy, if his wife will
condescend to occupy herself at all with domestic
affairs, and things so common as the concerns of the
family. An irreligious woman is as much to be abhorred
as a drunken woman: she is no longer fit to
lead in society and to give tone to its morals; she is
not fit to be a mother; for her children will surely
be reckless and godless; she is not a grace, but a blot
on her sex, disliked even by men who profess to no
religious conviction.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SPECIALLY FOR LADIES.</h2>


<p>What is becoming to one woman, may be just the
reverse to another, and in such a case it is foolish to
be the slave of fashion. A tall, elegant, and well-formed
figure requires a material that will exhibit and
set off to advantage these charms.</p>

<p>Velvet suits well a commanding figure which disdains
light materials, pale colors, and trifling ornaments.
In vain will a new fashion proffer its pretty
trinkets: the woman who possesses this classical figure
will disdain all such trifles. Her style of head-dress
will be chaste; diamond ornaments will sparkle
on her bosom; she is a queen, and should wear the
ornaments of royalty, provided she can do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>A young girl, all grace and elegance, will robe her
sylph-like form in the most transparent of textures;
she will place a fresh garland on her charming brow.
Every thing in her dress should correspond to the
freshness of her smile, to the sweetness of her expression.</p>

<p>We must, moreover, counsel our fair friends not to
spoil their beauty by any act of their own. To explain
ourselves further:</p>

<p>We will suppose you to possess a beautiful face,
and you have every interest in preserving its regularity.
Now mark: If you experience the slightest
opposition, your features are not recognizable your
forehead is wrinkled, you are ten years older!</p>

<p>Are you angry? your nose contracts, your upper
lip is elongated, your eyes are half covered by their
lids; you are frightfully ugly!</p>

<p>Are you afraid? your eyebrows are raised, your
mouth is half open, and you look like a simpleton!</p>

<p>Are you cold? all your features are contracted,
every muscle of your face is in a state of tension,
your neck sinks between your shoulders, you are
hunch-backed; consequently the blood, less active in
this semi-circular position, makes you still colder than
if you walked on boldly, and you have further the
advantage of looking like a little old man!</p>

<p>Are you negligent in your dress, careless in your
habits, idle and listless? your face gradually assumes
an expression of creticism, which makes your eyes
lose all their vivacity, and your countenance its
charms!</p>

<p>Consult your mirror when you experience one of
these feelings, and you will hardly recognize yourself.</p>

<p>Since God has given you an agreeable countenance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
do not deface his work&mdash;all the world will be gainers
and yourself also.</p>

<p>Alas! what shall we say to those who have not
been favored with a charming countenance? In such
a case there is almost always a compensation of Nature's
own providing. You will observe that with
unprepossessing features, there is generally an elegant
figure, or a great deal of expression, or lively wit,
that makes you forget that Nature has been less
bountiful than is her wont.</p>

<p>Fanciful modes of dress suit the coquette; she
knows how to make use of them: they are her counters.
She has the art of arranging tastefully even the
folds of her dress. Her costume should be full of
variety, to be the reflection of her caprices.</p>

<h2>CONFIDENTIAL ADVICE TO YOUNG MEN.</h2>


<p>We have given such specific directions as have
seemed to us necessary to form the gentleman. In
many cases it has been necessary to repeat admonitions
in order to impress on the mind of the reader
the propriety of certain special observances. Let this
excuse what may, at times, appear to be a repetition
or a tautology. In this chapter we wish to address
young men confidentially and candidly upon some of
those habits and ways of life which serve to mold
the character of the man to a considerable degree, and,
hence, are of vital importance in their relations to society
and to individuals.</p>

<p>A young man who starts out in life without any
settled purpose in mind, is laboring at great disadvantage.
He will waste several years in useless and
aimless endeavor to "get along," which he ought to
have given up to settling and systematizing his life-occupation.
If he is to learn a trade, let him resolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
upon it at as early a moment as is practicable, and
once resolved upon, let all his energies be devoted to
his pursuit. Success will be sure to follow such an
endeavor; and the age of twenty-five will, beyond
a doubt, if health does not fail, find the young man a
respected member of community, an efficient workman
earning a liberal living, and well qualified to
enter upon the business and responsibilities of wedded
life. If, on the contrary, the young man allows his
majority to find him still deficient in a knowledge of
the trade he knows he must or ought to follow, it is
almost a moral certainty that he never will attain to
the efficiency, the industry, and self-reliance which,
otherwise, must have marked him. Learn your
trade, then, ere your majority comes; and, when
once learned, remember that,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Through long days of labor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And nights devoid of ease,</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>spring those blessings and rewards which almost
inevitably follow upon endeavor rightly directed.</div>

<p>If you propose a commercial life, let there be no
hesitation in the decision; but go at it bravely, cheerfully,
persistently, that your majority may find you
enjoying the confidence of employers, and on the
high-road to your own independence. Remember,
solemnly remember, that incorruptible honesty, integrity
unimpeachable, virtue uncontaminated, are the
best riches the <i>heart</i> of man can ever attain&mdash;that
wealth gained at a sacrifice of any of these qualities
is a leprosy of gold which will cover the very soul
with loathsomeness. If the author of this chapter
had a million of dollars to bestow, it would be joyfully
hurled into the sea, to be lost forever, if its possessorship
could impair the virtue and moral excellence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of its recipients. View wealth, as honorable
only when honorably attained and rationally enjoyed;
and your life will be one which you, your friends,
and your children will call blessed.</p>

<p>If you design a professional life, it should be determined
on before the years of school-life are ended,
that you may direct your studies and mold your
thoughts into the most effective channels. As in a
commercial life, remember that the key-stone of success
lies in your honesty. A man who enters upon
the practice of the law, or of medicine merely for
gain, is starting out with a bad principle, which will
not fail to produce bad results even though wealth be
obtained; for, if purity of heart, disinterestedness,
self-respect are all gone, of what avail is <i>money</i>? The
veriest vagrant, who comes honestly by his poverty,
is a nobler being than he who comes dishonorably
by his wealth.</p>

<p>As has been said, in previous pages, gentility has
much to do with success in life. It opens a way for
progress where no rudeness would avail&mdash;it unlocks
sympathies, awakens friendships, commands confidences
which are better than mortgages and bonds in
our dealings with men; and we therefore commend
earnestly to your attention what we have said on
previous pages in regard to the rules and observances
of the good-breeding which indicates true gentility.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CULTIVATE A TASTE FOR THE BEAUTIFUL.</h2>


<p>What is "the beautiful?" It is what beautifies
and graces life. It is the antithesis of the real and
practical. It is the glory of life, for it elevates the
heart and mind into the contemplation of, and sympathy
with, the ideal&mdash;the spiritual. Its language is
the language of emotion; it startles, and thrills, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
stirs within us divine impulses. It comforts life, as
the shower comforts the parched grass; and penetrates
into the very recesses of our being, as the juices and
fluids penetrate the arteries and pores of the plant.</p>

<p>There is so much practicality in our American life,
that we are in danger of growing sordid, covetous,
unsympathetic, unpoetical; and our lives threaten to
be as barren of beauty as the pile of unhewn marble,
out of which the glorious edifice <i>can</i> be built, if only
the hand of the master touches it, and molds it into
forms of unity and grace. We want the hand of that
master to seize our being, to give it symmetry, to
develop its latent glories, to prove its power for developing
a fair humanity. The Master already is at
the door!</p>

<p>In the cultivation of a taste for music, flowers, and
home ornamentation, for art and poetry, for female
purity and spiritual grace, we find the means of a
right development. These are the messengers of the
beautiful, and by their guidance we approach the true
shrine.</p>

<p>It is one of the most cheering signs of our civilization,
that a taste for music and art is fast spreading
among all classes of the American people. Pictures
and books are now found in houses where, a few
years since, they were utter strangers, and their introduction
has caused such a delightful change! That
once hard repulsive room is now pleasant, and grace
sits at the door. What has wrought the change. A
picture or two on the walls, a carpet on the bare
floor, a fine book upon the table&mdash;these are the secret
of the new order which reigns there. And as the
taste for these things expands, there will be still more
beauty around that house. Vines will creep over the
door, the yard will be turned into form and shape, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
piano will enter over the door-sill, and "send its
wild echoes flying" through all the rooms to make
hearts beat with new emotions. Then must follow
that intelligence which has the truest appreciation of
life, which sees something else in existence than the
mere necessities of subsistence, which finds in nature
a language before dead, or unmeaning.</p>

<p>A young man should lend himself to think and
talk of art, of music, etc., etc.; should visit picture
galleries and libraries; should attend good lectures
and good concerts, and thus to acquire a taste for
such recreation, to fill his mind with good thoughts,
and to start in his soul noble aspirations. He who
pursues this course, and leaves to others the bar-room,
the billiard-room, the race-course, the club-room, is as
sure of a high reward, as that intellect and virtue are
above mere physical enjoyment and grossness.</p>

<p>Without doubt, the worst enemy of the young man
is the drinking and smoking saloon. While we make
no pretensions to total abstinence in the use of spirits,
we still believe, from a long experience and close
observation, that a bar-room resort is that fatal "first
step," which starts the career of dissipation, debauchery,
and crime. The associations one meets there,
the whole moral atmosphere and presence, are deadening
to right principles, destructive of right impressions.
Beware of them, O young man, is the earnest
admonition we have to give to him who peruses this
little chapter.</p>

<p>A good antidote to the bad habit of frequenting
these too-common places of resort, is to seek the
society of intelligent, virtuous females; to go out with
them, to sing with them, read with them, talk with
them. A true woman's influence is ennobling, and
she truly is the director of our race, if we but allow
her her real rights to our devotion and our trust.</p>

<h2>ETIQUETTE OF HORSEBACK RIDING.</h2>


<p>The very delightful recreation and exercise of riding
on horseback is too little partaken of in these days of
fast locomotion. This is to be regretted, for nothing
is better calculated to develop the physical health and
animal spirits, nothing is more conducive to pleasure
of a rational character, than the ride on horseback
upon every pleasant day.</p>

<p>The etiquette of such occasions is simple enough.
The lady should have the left, that the skirt may be
outside and not interfered with. The gentleman
should never be in <i>advance</i> of the lady, but always a
little in the rear, yet constantly near enough for any
emergency, or for a chat. The ceremony of mounting
and dismounting is to be learned by practice; no
etiquette can teach it. It is, of course, the gentleman's
place to gallant the lady out, taking her by her left
hand, as, with her right, she must support her skirt;
he must assist her to mount by holding the stirrup for
her foot, and by disposing of her skirt after she is
seated.</p>

<p>The dress of the lady, upon such occasions, is not
well understood, by most of our ladies. The English
women ride very much, both alone and accompanied,
on horseback; sometimes even participating in the
exciting and daring race of the hunt. Their dress is
the result of four hundred years of experiment and
experience, and we therefore quote the following from
a late work on the subject, recently published in
London:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Few ladies know how to dress for horse exercise,
although there has been a great improvement, so far
as taste has been concerned, of late years. As to the
head-dress, it may be whatever is in fashion, provided
it fits the head so as not to require continual adjustment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
often needed when the hands would be better
employed with the reins and whip. It should shade
from the sun, and, if used in hunting, protect the nape
of the neck from rain. The recent fashions of wearing
the plumes or feathers of the ostrich, the cock,
the capercailzie, the pheasant, the peacock, and kingfisher,
in the riding-hats of young ladies, in my humble
opinion, are highly to be commended. As to the
riding habit, it may be of any color or material, suitable
to the wearer and season of the year, but the
sleeves must fit rather closely; nothing can be more
out of place, inconvenient, and ridiculous, than the
wide hanging sleeves which look so well in a drawing-room.
For country use, the skirt of the habit may
be short, and bordered at the bottom a foot deep with
leather. The fashion of a waistcoat of light material
for summer, revived from the fashion of last century,
is a decided improvement; and so is the over-jacket
of cloth or seal-skin for rough weather. It is the
duty of every woman to dress in as becoming and
attractive a manner as possible; there is no reason
why pretty young girls should not indulge in picturesque
riding-costume, so long as it is appropriate.
Many ladies entirely spoil the 'set' of their dress
skirts, by retaining the usual <i>impedimenta</i> of petticoats.
The best horsewomen wear nothing more than a flannel
chemise, with long, colored sleeves. Ladies trowsers
should be of the same material and color as the
habit; and, if full, flowing like a Turk's, and fastened
with an elastic band round the ankle, they will not
be distinguished from the skirt. In this costume,
which may be made amply warm by the folds of the
trowsers, plaited like a Highlander's kilt (fastened
with an elastic band at the waist), a lady can sit down
in a manner impossible for one encumbered by two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
or three short petticoats. It is the chest and back
that require double folds of protection during and
after stormy exercise. There is a prejudice against
ladies wearing long Wellington boots, but it is quite
absurd, for they need never be seen, and are a great
comfort and protection in riding long distances, when
worn with trowsers tucked inside. They should, for
obvious reasons, be large enough for warm woolen
stockings, and easy to get on and off. It would not
look well to see a lady struggling out of a pair of wet
boots, with the help of a bootjack and a couple of
chambermaids. The heels of riding-boots, whether
for ladies or gentlemen, should be low, but long to
keep the stirrup in its place."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>HOW TO ORDER A HOME.&mdash;RULES FOR HOME CONDUCT
AND FAMILY ETIQUETTE.</h2>


<p>As we have said, all <i>true</i> politeness is founded in
kindness and unselfishness. Nowhere is there a better
chance for its better display than in the family
circle. Here we may be certain that it springs from
genuine goodness, as there is nothing to be gained by
its practice, except the reward which comes from all
well-doing. We may say that in no place is there so
much <i>need</i> of its exercise, in order to keep the wheels
of life running smoothly; for "family jars," as they
are laughingly called, are very apt to occur, unless
the oil of kindness is used to subdue the friction.
Children should always show their parents that respect
and tenderness which is <i>their due</i>. Even where
they may consider that they have been unjustly dealt
with, it is well for them to remember their own inexperience,
that, possibly, their judgment may not be as
perfect as they now believe it to be; and that, at all
events, the love and care bestowed upon them, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
helpless days of their childhood, entitle their parents
to regard and consideration.</p>

<p>For children to place their parents in a ridiculous
light before others, mocking their defects, or appearing
too conscious of their old-fashioned manners, is only
a proof of their own weakness, and will lessen them
in the esteem of any amiable person.</p>

<p>For children to assume the most comfortable chairs,
the most conspicuous places, or, in any way, to intrude
themselves first, to the neglect of then parents,
is a very grave fault.</p>

<p>It is desirable to take the first step in the courtesies
of the day, which engender so much pleasant feeling,
by meeting the different members of the family with a
cheerful "Good-morning."</p>

<p>It is highly desirable that, at table, the same rules
of precedence, the same moderation and nicety be observed
which would be practiced if guests were present.
Fixed <i>habits</i> of politeness will only be attained
where they are cultivated <i>at home</i>.</p>

<p>No scrambling, haste, untidiness, or noise should
be allowed among the younger members of the circle.
They should be made to wait quietly until their elders
are served, to eat without unseemly greediness,
and drink without labored breathing or spasmodic
sounds. If early trained to propriety, it will not be
necessary to banish them from the table every time
that company is present. Such banishment will tend
to make them awkward and lacking in self-possession;
though, of course, well-governed children will
wait cheerfully when there is necessity for it.</p>

<p>A pleasant "thank you," or "I'm obliged to you,"
spoken by one sister to another, to a brother, or a
mother, for a favor conferred, will last, even in a selfish
point of view; for it will increase the <i>disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to be kind</i>, and will lighten the burden of any little
service unmistakably. Children should never press
around a visitor with the question, "How long are
you going to stay?" nor around a relative or parent,
returned from an absence, with, "What have you
brought me?" "Did you bring me any thing pretty?"
If they have reason to expect a present, let them refrain
from alluding to it, lest the friend should suspect
they thought more of the gift than of welcoming the
giver.</p>

<p>If a new member enters the family, as the bride of
a brother, or the husband of a sister, true good-breeding
can never appear to better advantage, than in the
kind reception and treatment of the new-comer.
Ideas and habits in such an one, differing from those
of the circle into which he or she may have come, should
not be too severely criticised; for, it should be remembered,
they have probably been differently educated.
Even faults should be as charitably viewed
as possible; and where respect and love are impossible,
it is still best for those who <i>must</i> dwell together,
to exercise Christian forbearance, and not forget such
courtesies as the case admits of.</p>

<p>If you have invited guests, forget your own pleasure
in consulting theirs; never do or say a rude thing
to a guest. Many a jest, sarcasm, inattention, or
slight, which would be excusable anywhere else, becomes
a rudeness if it happens under your own roof
to a person calling upon or visiting you. Even in a
friendly argument, be careful not to forget yourself,
and take sides too warmly <i>against</i> your opponent, if
he be also your visitor or guest.</p>

<p>If you have extended a special invitation to a
friend at a distance to come and remain with you for
a time, if the friend be a lady, and arrives by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
public conveyance, have yourself, your carriage, or
some messenger at the spot of arrival to conduct her
to your residence. The house should be in good order,
that she may not feel disconcerted, nor that she is an
intruder. Have all things prepared to give her a
cheerful welcome. Let her not suffer from the neglect
to provide for her comfort those things which
she would not like to be compelled to ask for. Her
room should be well supplied with the means of bathing
and refreshing herself, and for arranging her
toilet. The bureau should have empty drawers for
the accommodation of her muslins, and the closet
empty pegs for the reception of her dresses. She
should be consulted as to the <i>kind</i> of bed she prefers,
and allowed to retire early, the first evening, if fatigued
with her journey. As some people are in the
habit of sleeping under more covering than others,
there should be a certainty of plenty, especially if the
weather be chilly or changeable.</p>

<p>She should be made to feel <i>welcome</i>, and be honored
by such civilities as will please her. If she is
fond of company, and expects to be introduced to
your circle of friends, you should apprise your friends
in advance of her visit, that they may call upon her
after her arrival.</p>

<p>The table should be neat and furnished with suitable
dishes. Of course, your means and habits, will
influence the amount of expense and trouble you can
afford to go to; what we mean is, that a guest should
not be left to feel neglected or uncared for. We have
said "lady," in speaking of the visitor; but the same
rules will be observed toward guests of the other sex;
only they are not usually so much in the house, do
not absorb so much of your time, nor require so much
company. The gentleman of the house will see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
his friend is amused and cared for when out with
him during those hours not usually spent at home.</p>

<p>Do not allow your children to be troublesome to
visitors; to climb upon them, soil their dresses with
their fingers, handle their jewelry and ornaments, ask
annoying questions, nor intrude themselves into their
private apartments at unseasonable hours; nor ever,
without first knocking and waiting to be bidden to
come in. Do not, yourself, intrude without knocking;
nor allow your servants to do so.</p>

<p>To permit children to ask visitors for money, or
for articles in their possession, which the children
may admire, is extremely out of place.</p>

<p>To permit children to follow company about, never
giving them a moment of retirement, standing by
while they make their toilet, and at all times and
seasons, is not only annoying, but is vulgar.</p>

<p>If you have invited a friend or friends to tea, have
every thing in readiness by the earliest hour at which
they may be expected. Do not let them find fires
just lighted, yourself not dressed, nor other evidences
that they have arrived too soon.</p>

<p>Usually guests&mdash;especially ladies&mdash;will desire to lay
aside their outer garments in some dressing-room,
where they can give a glance at their hair, or arrange
their dress, before being ushered into the parlor. If
you have asked a gentleman friend, whom you knew
has just come from his place of business, give him an
opportunity of bathing his face and hands, and brushing
his hair.</p>

<p>There are many little attentions to the entertainment
and comfort of others which will not be wanting
where the will is good and the heart sincere.
<i>Try to make all feel at ease and happy in your house.</i></p>

<p>While every attention is counseled to be shown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
guests, let it not be supposed that <i>show</i> and <i>seeming</i>,
to "keep up appearances" before others, is what is
sought.</p>

<p>The inmates of the same house should endeavor to
be agreeable to one another. No outside admiration
can compensate for the want of love and respect at
home. Gross neglect of attire, unseemly morning
apparel, uncombed hair, and total neglect of those
little arts and charms which make the female portion
of the household so much more lovable, are inexcusable.
We should bear in mind that the love of
friends is worth more than the flattery of strangers.
Only absolute ill-health, or great stress of employment,
can excuse slovenly appearances at <i>any</i> hour of the
day, in any member of the family.</p>

<p>The table should <i>always</i> be laid with a certain degree
of care. Dishes should not be huddled on, nor
dirty table-linen allowed, because there is no company
to criticise. This will be one of the <i>surest tests</i>
of the refinement of a family.</p>

<p>The birthdays of the different members should be
honored with good wishes; and gifts, however trifling,
if affectionately given, help to keep up that kindly
feeling which is the life of the social circle.</p>

<p>It is well to have a few feast-days in the course of
the year. Life was not made entirely for labor; and
an occasional holiday is a bright spot for children to
look back to when they are no longer children. This
is only <i>a hint</i>&mdash;we would not assert it to be "etiquette."</p>

<p>While children should honor their parents, parents
should never seek to humiliate or degrade their children.
It is bad policy to assert to a child, "You
were always bad," "There is no good in you," "You
are a liar," or, "You have disgraced yourself beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
forgiveness." Teach your children to respect <i>your</i>
moderation, if you wish them to govern <i>their</i> passions.
Teach them to respect themselves, if you wish
them to possess any manliness or sense of honor.</p>

<p>Never <i>scold</i>. Administer reproof in a calm manner;
it will be much more effective, while it will not
fail to preserve the respect of your servants and children
much more successfully and satisfactorily than
the harsher course.</p>

<p>If visitors call when it is impossible or very inconvenient
for you to see them, do not be afraid to send
word that you are engaged. They have no right to
be offended. Better far to tell the truth than to send
the false and silly message, that you are "not at home."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CARDS OF INVITATION, WEDDING CARDS, ETC.</h2>


<p>In inviting persons to an evening party, the form
is: "Mrs. E. would be pleased to see Mr. and Mrs.
D. at her house, on Thursday evening;" or, "Mrs.
E.'s compliments to Mr. and Mrs. D., for Thursday
evening;" or, "Mrs. E. at home on Thursday evening;"
addressing the envelope to Mr. and Mrs. D.</p>

<p>If to a dinner-party, the form is much the same,
only the hour is added, thus: "Mrs. E. at home
Thursday evening. Dinner at six o'clock." In case
the hour is named, the guest commits a great discourtesy
in not being on hand at that hour precisely.</p>

<p>If a dance is proposed, it is proper to word the invitation,
so as to inform the invited of the fact, thus:
"Mrs. E.'s compliments for Thursday evening, to
music and dancing;" or, "Mrs. E. will be pleased to
see her friends, Thursday, at 8 <small>P. M.</small>, to a dance."</p>

<p>When it is a public ball, or a stated soiree, the form
of invitation is more formal: "Your company is
solicited to a ball (or soiree, or party dansante), to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
given at the Metropolitan Rooms, on the evening of
Thursday, Dec. 10th, 1860." Then follow the names
of the managing committee. This invitation should
always be sent at least one week beforehand, in order
to give ladies time to prepare their dresses.</p>

<p>If it is impossible from sickness, or otherwise, to
accept an invitation to a private party, an excuse, or
declination, should invariably be sent in on the <i>day
prior</i> to the party, that the lady of the house may be
advised as to who is coming and who is not. This
is a rule too little observed, but a really necessary
one, to be made the study of all to practice. For a
gentleman not to attend a party, after having received
an invitation, and to send in no excuse for absence, is
to be construed into a designed "cut," or as an evidence
of ignorance. In many cases&mdash;particularly in
cities&mdash;the rule is to send in notes of acceptance of
invitation; but this is a superfluous ceremony, when
it is understood that silence gives consent. The form
of a declination of invitation is: "Mr. and Mrs. D.
regret their inability to attend upon Mrs. E.'s invitation
for Thursday evening." Or, when a good excuse
is desirable, say: "Mr. and Mrs. D. greatly regret
that sickness (or other and prior engagements) will
prevent their acceptance of Mrs. E.'s kind invitation
for Thursday evening."</p>

<p>In all cases of invitations or declinations, the date
of writing should be placed on the left hand, below.</p>

<p>A plain, satin surfaced note paper, should be used,
and the note should be inclosed in an envelope prepared
for note paper, and be directed simply: "Mr.
and Mrs. D.&mdash;Present;" and if sons and daughters
are invited out of the same household, separate invitations
should be sent to each. If a person is worth
inviting at all, it is but proper that a <i>whole note</i> should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
be inclosed. In case of husband and wife, as the law
pronounces them "one," a single note will serve for both.</p>

<p>For visiting cards, the custom changes often.
Sometimes it is a glazed card, sometimes not; sometimes
a large one, sometimes a small one; sometimes
with silvered edges, sometimes with golden border;
sometimes with printed inscription, sometimes engraved,
sometimes written in pencil. Any person
designing to get up a set of visiting or wedding cards,
should consult a good engraver; or, if no such person
is near, should obtain from some friend, "just from
the Metropolis," the "style." The usual form for
visiting cards, is simply the name, no address being,
given, as that belongs to business. For wedding
cards, the style now in vogue is two cards in one
envelop, one inscribed with the lady's maiden name,
the other with the name of husband and wife, thus:
"Mr. and Mrs. John Dean." If these are sent out
before the wedding, and are designed as invitations to
the ceremony, there is added to the last-named card
the words: "At home, Thursday morning, at ten
o'clock;" or, as the case may be, in the evening; or,
if at church, say: "At St. John's Church, at 10 <small>A. M.</small>,
Thursday."</p>

<p>Letters of introduction have before been referred to.
They should say: "The bearer, Mr. Horatio Green, is
solicitous of your acquaintance (or friendship, or advice,
or good offices, as the case may be), and I take
pleasure in commending him to your favorable attention."
In the envelope, along with the introductory
note, should be the card of the person introduced.</p>

<p>Neither letters of introduction, nor cards of invitation,
should be sealed, except they must be transmitted
by mail, in which case reinclose the whole in another
envelope for the mail.</p>

<p>In addition to the peculiar merits that have won for these
instruments their enviable reputation, they comprise all the</p>

<p>MODERN IMPROVEMENTS,</p>

<p><i>possessing</i> any <i>real merit</i>.</p>

<p>FOR PURITY OF TONE, DELICACY OF TOUCH, DURABILITY,
and their capacity for enduring the ravages of <i>severe
climates</i>, the "STODART" PIANO FORTE stands unrivalled.</p>

<p>The Pianos of the above manufacture have stood the test of
more than a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>For the superiority of these celebrated instruments, the
manufacturers are at liberty to refer to over</p>

<p>FIFTEEN THOUSAND</p>

<p>families who have them in use, and in nearly every part of the
civilized world.</p>

<p>Parties abroad favoring us with their orders, can rely upon
being as well served, as if they were to make a selection themselves,
and at modest prices and satisfactory terms.</p>
